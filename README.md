## Hi there, I'm Tom 👋
### Senior Technical Lead | Building systems that matter
I'm passionate about creating technology that genuinely serves people's needs. With 10+ years in software engineering, I've led teams building everything from AI assistants that help families navigate complex legal advice to critical COVID-19 support services used by millions.
### 🚀 What I'm working on
Currently tech leading data engineering projects at HMCTS, building live reporting services that turn operational chaos into actionable insights. Recently wrapped up an AI assistant prototype for family law that users said helped them find in one step what they'd been searching for weeks.
### 🛠️ My toolkit
I believe in strong architectural fundamentals over technology trends, but here's what I've been coding with lately:

Languages: Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, Go, Kotlin
Architecture: Domain Driven Design, CQRS, Microservices
Cloud: AWS, Azure (including Azure Fabric for big data)
Data: SQL, GraphQL, data engineering pipelines
AI/ML: Amazon Bedrock, IBM AI Developer Certification, building user-centered AI experiences

### 🎯 What drives me
User-centered engineering - Technology should solve real problems for real people. Whether it's helping vulnerable citizens access support during a pandemic or making government data accessible to everyone from researchers to curious citizens.
Leading through complexity - I've rescued failed projects, built award-winning services under extreme pressure, and helped teams navigate the messiness of government digital transformation.
Growing people and communities - Currently mentoring 4 developers and leading our Software Engineering community of practice. There's nothing quite like watching someone level up their skills.

### 🏆 Things I'm proud of
Built the COVID-19 Shielding Service at GDS - an award-winning service that supported vulnerable people during lockdown
Led the Ethnicity Facts and Figures platform - bringing together all UK government ethnicity data in an accessible way
Created AI prototypes now being used across multiple government departments
Delivered the Census 2021 data platform, handling one of the largest data releases in UK government history

### 📈 By the numbers

10+ years in software engineering
Multiple award-winning government digital services
Millions of users served by platforms I've built
Zero major incidents on services I've led (touch wood 🤞)
